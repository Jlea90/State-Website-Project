                        Bristol, Rhode Island, is a town steeped in rich history, dating back to its incorporation in 1747. Originally founded in 1680, Bristol became a bustling port town due to its strategic location along Narragansett Bay, attracting merchants, shipbuilders, and traders. Its maritime heritage is still evident in the town’s historic architecture and the preservation of colonial homes and landmarks, such as the Blithewold Mansion and Gardens and Linden Place. Bristol is also home to the oldest Fourth of July celebration in the United States, a tradition that began in 1785 and continues to this day, drawing visitors from near and far to experience the town’s deep sense of patriotism and community.
